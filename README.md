# C-SharpProjects
 This is where I store my projects I have written using C# and the .NET Framework. Most of my projects and assignments can be found in the 'Basic_C#_Programs' folder.

# Main Projects:
• Car Insurance App 'CarInsurance'  
• Twenty One Game 'TwentyOne'

# Car Insurance:
This project is a web appliction using ASP.NET, using MVC as the desing pattern, with CRUD functionality built in, that allows a user to enter information about themselves and about the type of coverage they want, stores it in a database, and calculates using logic the amount the users car insurance would be based on built in criteria. 

# Tweny One Game:
This project is a fully functioning console game of BlackJack, that includes a deck of cards constructor, a dynamic shuffling method, and player and dealer classes. This app also includes betting, actively tracks both dealer, and player's hands, and determines the winner through built int logic.
